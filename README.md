# Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Introduction:
  - This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.
  - The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
  - It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a [PCA transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).
  - Feature 'Class' is the target feature variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
