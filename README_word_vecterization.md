# Word Vecterization
### When any input feature comes from a finite (or a countably infinite) set, it is a discrete type. In NLP, we regard words, characters and letters as discrete symbols. Representing discrete types (e.g., words) as dense vectors is at the core of deep learningâ€™s successes in NLP. When the discrete types are words, the dense vector representation is called a <font color='red'>word embedding</font>.
